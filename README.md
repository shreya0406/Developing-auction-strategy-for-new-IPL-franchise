 Developing auction strategy for new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong
 and balanced squad
 #Background story
 Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during
 March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities or states in
 India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.
 The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average
 attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to
 be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of IPL in 2020 was estimated to be around â‚¹475
 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.
 The IPL tournament involves each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away, double
 round-robin format. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the basis of aggregate
 points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each
 other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator").
 While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team gets another
 chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match
 is titled Qualifier 2. The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match. The
 team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier League champion.
 Altogether, thirteen teams have played in the past ten seasons of the IPL tournament.] Of these, five
 teams are no longer a part of the tournament. In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise of Kochi
 Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan Chargers
 in 2012 for backing off from its commitments. In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after it had a
 franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were
 suspended in 2015 & 2016 following a betting controversy. However, in July 2017, BCCI announced
 that both Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals would be allowed back into the IPL
 competition from the 2018 season. The tournament featured eight teams for the 2020 season,
 including Delhi Capitals. Punjab Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore,
 Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians.
 Mumbai Indians have won five titles. Chennai Super Kings have won four titles and Kolkata Knight
 Riders have won two titles, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals, apart from
 former team Deccan Chargers, are the other teams to have won the tournament title.
 In a coming season a new team is being added to the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a mega
 auction is being held to build the team's squad, there are a few factors that the team's management
 and auction strategy would likely consider:
 1. Budget: The team would need to allocate a budget for the auction and decide how much
 money to spend on each player.
 2. Team needs: The team would need to identify the positions and types of players they need to
 fill out their squad and target those players in the auction.
 3. Player availability: The team would need to assess the availability of players, including their
 current contracts with other teams and their international commitments.
 4. Player form: The team would need to consider the recent form and performances of the
 players they are targeting.
5. Player value: The team would need to consider the market value of the players they are
 interested in and decide how much they are willing to pay for them.
 To build a strong and balanced squad, the team's management would likely need to strike a balance
 between all of these factors and come up with a well-thought-out auction strategy. This could involve
 targeting a few key players they consider to be game-changers, while also filling out the rest of the
 squad with more affordable players who can add value to the team. It could also involve making use
 of the various player retention and right to match options available to them.
 As the data analysis team leader of this new team, your first step would be to gather and analyze all
 available data on the players who are eligible for selection in the auction. This could include data on
 their past performance in domestic and international cricket, their current form and fitness, and any
 other relevant metrics such as fielding ability, bowling economy, and strike rate.
 Once you have gathered and analyzed this data, You can use it to create player profiles and
 rankings for all of the eligible players. This would involve assigning a value or rating to each player
 based on their performance and potential impact on the team.
 Using these player profiles and rankings, You can work with the team's management to create a list
 of target players for the auction. This list would include players who we believe would be the best
 value for money and who would fill the specific needs of our team.
 Finally, You would work with the team's auction strategy group to come up with a plan for the auction
 itself. This would involve deciding on the order in which we want to bid for players, setting limits on
 the amount we are willing to pay for each player, and making use of any player retention or right to
 match options we may have.

 Bidding on batters
 In T20 cricket, it is important for a team to have a balance of different types of batsmen in order
 to be successful in big tournaments.
 1. Aggressive batsmen: These batsmen play aggressively and look to score runs quickly by
 taking risks and hitting shots all around the ground. They are important because they
 can provide a fast start to the team's innings and put pressure on the opposition's
 bowlers. This can set the tone for the rest of the innings and give the team a good
 platform to build on.
 2. Anchor batsmen: These batsmen play a more defensive role, looking to hold one end up
 and build a solid foundation for the team's innings. They are important because they can
 provide stability to the team's innings and allow the other batsmen to play their natural
 game. They also play a crucial role in building partnerships and helping the team score
 consistently throughout the innings.
 3. Finishers: These batsmen come in to bat towards the end of the innings and look to hit
 big shots to help the team achieve a challenging total or chase down a target. They are
 crucial in the closing stages of the game because they have the ability to score runs
 quickly and take the pressure off the other batsmen.
4. Big-hitters: These batsmen have the ability to hit the ball a long way and are capable of
 scoring runs quickly. They are valuable in the middle overs of the game because they
 have the ability to take the attack to the opposition's bowlers and put pressure on them.
 5. Rotators of strike: These batsmen are good at finding gaps in the field and rotating the
 strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over. They are important because they can keep
 the run rate up and ensure that the team is able to maintain a good scoring rate
 throughout the innings. They also play a crucial role in building partnerships and helping
 the team score consistently.
 There are several strategies that an IPL team could use to try and acquire a batsman during the
 auction:
 1. Target a specific player: If a team has identified a specific batsman that they want to
 target, they could focus their efforts on bidding for that player and try to secure his
 services.
 2. Bid aggressively: If a team is keen to acquire a batsman, they could choose to bid
 aggressively and try to outbid other teams for the player's services.
 3. Use the Right to Match (RTM) card: If a batsman that a team is interested in is bought by
 another team, the team could use their Right to Match (RTM) card to match the other
 team's bid and retain the player's services.
 4. Build a strong squad and use it as a selling point: If a team has already built a strong
 squad and is looking to add another batsman to it, they could use this as a selling point
 to try and convince the player to join their team.
 5. Look for value picks: Instead of targeting the most expensive and high-profile aggressive
 batsmen, a team could look for value picks and try to acquire an aggressive batsman
 who is available at a lower price.
 Overall, the key to acquiring a batsman during the IPL auction is to have a clear strategy and be
 prepared to bid aggressively if necessary.
 Your first priority is to get 2-3 players with high S.R who have faced at least 500 balls.And
 to do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in the auction so that
 when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount greater than you
 have in the purse for a particular player.
 (strike rate is total runs scored by batsman divided by number of balls faced but remember
 when extras_type is 'wides' it is not counted as a ball faced neither counted as batsmen runs)
 After getting some Aggressive batters you need a few anchor batsmen in your team. In T20
 cricket, players with a good average are important for a number of reasons:
 1. Consistency: Players with a good average are generally more consistent performers,
 which is crucial in a format where a single player can have a big impact on the outcome
 of the game.
 2. Ability to score runs quickly: Players with a good average are often capable of scoring
 runs quickly, which is important in a format where teams are looking to score as many
 runs as possible in a limited amount of time.
3. Ability to build partnerships: Players with a good average are also generally good at
 building partnerships and helping the team score consistently throughout the innings.
 4. Ability to absorb pressure: Players with a good average are often able to absorb
 pressure and perform well under challenging circumstances, which is important in a
 format where there is always a lot of pressure on the batsmen.
 Overall, players with a good average are valuable assets to any T20 team because of their
 consistency, ability to score runs quickly, and ability to absorb pressure.
 Now you need to get 2-3 players with good Average who have played more than 2 ipl
 seasons. And to do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in the
 auction so that when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount
 greater than you have in the purse for a particular player.
 (Average is calculated as total runs scored divided by number of times batsman has been
 dismissed which can be calculated using wicket_ball field as 1 indicates out and 0 indicates not
 out, a batsman shouldâ€™ve been dismissed at least once to calculate the sr i.e., you can exclude
 those players who have not been dismissed once )
 After getting some Aggressive batsmen and anchor batsmen you need a few Hard hitters in
 your team. Hard-hitters are important in T20 cricket because they have the ability to score runs
 quickly and take the attack to the opposition's bowlers. Some of the key ways in which
 hard-hitters can impact a T20 game are:
 1. Change the momentum of the game: Hard-hitters have the ability to hit the ball a long
 way and score runs quickly, which can help to change the momentum of the game in
 their team's favor.
 2. Apply pressure on the opposition: Hard-hitters can put pressure on the opposition's
 bowlers by scoring runs quickly and forcing them to bowl to their strengths.
 3. Score big runs in the death overs: Hard-hitters are particularly valuable in the death
 overs, when teams are looking to score as many runs as possible. They have the ability
 to hit big shots and help the team post a challenging total or chase down a target.
 4. Create excitement: Hard-hitters can also create excitement among fans and make T20
 cricket more entertaining to watch.
 Overall, hard-hitters are important in T20 cricket because of their ability to score runs quickly,
 apply pressure on the opposition, and create excitement.
 Now you need to get 2-3 Hard-hitting players who have scored most runs in boundaries
 and have played more the 2 ipl season. To do that you have to make a list of 10 players
 you want to bid in the auction so that when you try to grab them in auction you should
 not pay the amount greater than you have in the purse for a particular player.
 (only 4 and 6 will be counted as boundaries so calculate how many 4 and 6 has been hit by
 each batsman and also calculate total runs scored to get the output as boundary percentage
 which will be runs in boundary divided by total runs scored)
Bidding on Bowlers
 After making a list of batsmans we want to bid in the auction now we need to find some good
 bowlers as well.
 Bowlers are important in an IPL team for several reasons some of them are:
 1. Wicket-taking ability: Good bowlers have the ability to take wickets and break
 partnerships, which can be crucial in a format where a single player can have a big
 impact on the outcome of the game. Taking wickets helps to put pressure on the
 opposition and disrupt their batting lineup, making it easier for the team to defend a low
 total or chase down a target.
 2. Control: Good bowlers are able to maintain a good level of control over their deliveries,
 which allows them to keep the scoring rate in check and prevent the opposition from
 scoring too many runs. This is important because it gives the team a better chance of
 winning the game by limiting the opposition's scoring opportunities.
 3. Ability to bowl in different situations: Good bowlers have the ability to bowl effectively in
 different situations, whether it be at the start of the innings, in the middle overs, or in the
 death overs. This is important because it gives the team flexibility in terms of their
 bowling options and allows them to choose the best bowlers for the specific situation.
 4. Ability to bowl in different conditions: Good bowlers are also able to adapt to different
 conditions and bowl effectively in a range of environments. This is important because the
 IPL is played in different venues across the country, each of which has its own unique
 pitch and weather conditions. Bowlers who are able to adapt to these conditions are
 more valuable to the team.
 Economical bowlers are important in T20 cricket because they have the ability to restrict the
 opposition's scoring and put pressure on the batsmen. Some of the key ways in which
 economical bowlers can impact a T20 game are:
 1. Control the run rate: Economical bowlers are able to maintain a good level of control
 over their deliveries and limit the number of runs that are scored off them. This helps to
 keep the run rate in check and makes it more difficult for the opposition to score runs
 quickly.
 2. Force the batsmen to take risks: Economical bowlers can also force the batsmen to take
 risks in order to score runs, which can lead to wickets as they try to hit out.
 3. Create pressure on the opposition: Economical bowlers are able to create pressure on
 the opposition by making it difficult for them to score runs. This can lead to mistakes and
 wickets as the batsmen try to score too quickly.
 4. Allow the team to defend a low total: Economical bowlers can also be crucial in helping a
 team defend a low total, as they are able to restrict the opposition's scoring and make it
 more difficult for them to chase down the target.
 Overall, economical bowlers are important in T20 cricket because of their ability to control the
 run rate, force the batsmen to take risks, create pressure on the opposition, and help the team
 defend a low total.Talking about the bowlers tally In cricket, a bowler's tally includes all of the
 deliveries that they have bowled, regardless of whether they have resulted in a wicket or not.
 This includes legitimate balls (which are bowled in accordance with the rules of the game), as
 well as no balls (which are illegal deliveries) and wides (which are balls that are too wide or high
 to be hit by the batsman).
Therefore, a bowler's tally includes all of the balls that they have bowled, whether they have
 been hit for runs or not, and whether they have resulted in a wicket or not. It is a measure of the
 bowler's overall performance and gives an indication of how many deliveries they have bowled
 in their career.
 Your first priority is to get 2-3 bowlers with good economy who have bowled at least 500
 balls in IPL so far.To do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in the
 auction so that when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount
 greater than you have in the purse for a particular player.(economy can be calculated by
 dividing total runs conceded with total overs bowled)
 After adding Economical bowlers into your team you need to find some wicket taking bowlers.
 Wicket-taking bowlers are important in the IPL for several reasons some of them are:
 1. Ability to break partnerships: Wicket-taking bowlers have the ability to take wickets and
 break partnerships, which can be crucial in a format where a single player can have a
 big impact on the outcome of the game. Taking wickets helps to put pressure on the
 opposition and disrupt their batting lineup, making it easier for the team to defend a low
 total or chase down a target.
 2. Ability to create pressure: Wicket-taking bowlers are also able to create pressure on the
 opposition by making it difficult for them to score runs. This can lead to mistakes and
 wickets as the batsmen try to score too quickly. This is because wicket-taking bowlers
 have the ability to take wickets at regular intervals, which puts pressure on the batsmen
 to score runs and can lead to mistakes.
 3. Contribution to team's success: Wicket-taking bowlers are an important contributor to a
 team's success in the IPL, as they have the ability to turn a match in the team's favor by
 taking wickets at crucial times. For example, if a team is defending a low total,
 wicket-taking bowlers can take wickets at regular intervals to put pressure on the
 opposition and make it more difficult for them to chase down the target. Similarly, if a
 team is chasing a target, wicket-taking bowlers can take wickets to disrupt the
 opposition's batting lineup and make it easier for the team to chase down the target.
 4. Role in building a strong team: Wicket-taking bowlers are also an important part of
 building a strong team in the IPL, as they provide the team with a valuable wicket-taking
 option and help to balance the team's attack. In order to be successful in the IPL, teams
 need to have a good mix of bowlers who can take wickets, as well as bowlers who can
 maintain a good level of control and restrict the opposition's scoring. Wicket-taking
 bowlers are an important part of this mix, as they provide the team with a wicket-taking
 option that can be used to put pressure on the opposition and disrupt their batting lineup.
 Now you need to get 2-3 bowlers with the best strike rate and who have bowled at least
 500 balls in IPL so far.To do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in
 the auction so that when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount
 greater than you have in the purse for a particular player.
 (strike rate of a bowler can be calculated by number of balls bowled divided by total wickets
 taken )
All-Rounders
 After getting the best bowlers and batters you need few all rounders in your team.
 In T20 cricket, all-rounders are players who are skilled at both batting and bowling. They are
 valuable to a team because they provide flexibility to the lineup and can contribute in multiple
 ways.
 One of the main ways that all-rounders can contribute in T20 cricket is by scoring runs quickly
 and effectively. In T20 cricket, teams often need to score runs at a fast pace, and all-rounders
 who can hit the ball hard and rotate the strike are valuable assets. They can also provide a
 steadying influence if the team is under pressure, as they have the experience and skills to build
 an innings.
 All-rounders are also valuable because they can bowl effectively in different situations. In T20
 cricket, teams often have to make quick adjustments to their game plan, and all-rounders who
 can bowl a variety of deliveries and execute their skills under pressure can be very useful. They
 can bowl in the powerplay, in the middle overs, or at the death, and they can be used to exploit
 the opposition's weaknesses or contain the scoring.
 All-rounders can also provide insurance for a team in case of injuries or poor form by other
 players. For example, if a team's main fast bowler is injured, an all-rounder who can bowl at
 pace can help fill the void. Similarly, if a team's top order batsmen are struggling, an all-rounder
 who can score runs and provide stability to the innings can be valuable.
 Overall, all-rounders are valuable in T20 cricket because they provide teams with versatility and
 options, and they can be key contributors to a team's success in the format.
 Now you need to get 2-3 All_rounders with the best batting as well as bowling strike rate
 and who have faced at least 500 balls in IPL so far and have bowled minimum 300
 balls.To do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in the auction so
 that when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount greater than
 you have in the purse for a particular player.
 ( strike rate of an all rounder can be calculated using the same criteria of batsman similarly the
 bowling strike rate can be calculated using the criteria of a bowler)
 Wicketkeeper
 Now, after adding all these players, this team is still incomplete because we donâ€™t have any
 wicketkeeper. In T20 cricket, the role of the wicketkeeper is slightly different from that in longer
 forms of the game. In T20, the emphasis is on scoring runs quickly, so the wicketkeeper is often
 expected to contribute to the team's run total with aggressive batting. They may also be called
 upon to bowl a few overs of spin or medium pace.
 Defensively, the wicketkeeper still has an important role to play, as they are responsible for
 catching and stumping the batsman. In T20 cricket, where every run and wicket is crucial, a
 good wicket keeper can make a big difference to the team's chances of winning.
 Overall, the wicketkeeper is an important member of a T20 team and can have a significant
 impact on the outcome of a match. Now suppose you are provided with a list of wicketkeeper
 names, and your task is to define the criteria for choosing the two best wicket keepers from all
 those names.Try to define a criteria best suited for a wicketkeeper required in a t20 team so that
 your team will be complete and have everything required for winning this yearâ€™s IPL.
After doing all that you have the list of all the players you are going to bid in the auction
 so create a visual representation in the form of graphs , tables and charts to present in
 front of team management before the auction.
